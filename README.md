# System Design Fundamentals to Advanced

This repository contains my personal notes, resources, and class-wise breakdown of **System Design** concepts.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in **Database Engineering, DBMS, Networking, Scalability, Reliability, and Architectural Patterns** â€” moving from **fundamentals to advanced**.

- Isolation Levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)
- Isolation Terminology (Dirty Reads, Non-Repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads)

### 3. Operating System
- OS Basics
- Process vs Thread
- Concurrency & Synchronization

### 4. Networking
